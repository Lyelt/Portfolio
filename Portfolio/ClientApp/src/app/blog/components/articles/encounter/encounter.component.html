    <blog-section-title>From Idea to Implementation</blog-section-title>
    <blog-p>
      The initial idea for this project actually stemmed from a real-life problem I was having every week.
      My friends and I would gather every Saturday to play <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a>.
      In my group, I am the designated note-taker; I document the group’s adventures so that we can look back week by week and see what happened.

      In D&D, it is pretty common to encounter “enemies” that must be battled. In fact, for us, this happens just about every session.
      What I noticed was the following: <strong>sessions that were heavy in combat had very few notes</strong>!
      I was always too focused on the combat to take notes, and much of the story-telling was on hold while we simply battled it out.

      So, what's the problem?
    </blog-h3>
    <blog-p>
      Well, I <em>wanted</em> to know what happened in a particular encounter.
      There were many fun moments that would get lost because I didn’t have the time to write them down.
      Not to mention the pain of actually <em>tracking</em> each player’s turn.
      If I had a dollar for every time I heard “whose turn is it?” or “did you skip my turn?”...
    </blog-p>
    <blog-p>
      The solution, in my mind, was to create an application that can be easily used for tracking a D&D encounter, including turn-by-turn note taking, turn-order tracking, and potentially even statistic tracking.

    <blog-section-title>Ready to Code... Right?</blog-section-title>
    <blog-p>
      With the idea vaguely in my head, I did what any starry-eyed developer would do - I started coding.
      I only knew Bootstrap and jQuery from work, but those wouldn’t do.
      Everyone said Angular, React, or Vue.
      So after not-quite-enough research, I landed on Angular because “Typescript is similar to C#”.
      Good enough for me.
    </blog-p>
    <blog-p>
      I dove in head-first, running into plenty of problems and questions on the way, but ignoring most of them.
      My usual justification was that <em>I'm only building it for myself</em> and <em>I’ll deal with the hard stuff later</em>.
      Once I had a basic initiative tracker that allowed me to enter some notes each turn, I was done.
      Well, not really, but I had <em>something</em>.
      Ultimately, though, I decided it wasn’t good enough. Instead of paying off some technical debt, I decided it needed more.

      Self-admittedly, this is where I started going off the rails a little bit.
      I imagined cataloging every single turn, every bit of damage dealt, every spell used, every action a character took.
      <em>It would be so cool to see statistics on your total damage… your most common spell used… everything!</em>

    <blog-section-title>Making the Customer Happy</blog-section-title>
    <blog-p>
      Well, as it turned out, I didn’t quite know what the customer actually wanted. Which is weird because I’m the only customer…
    </blog-p>
    <blog-p>
      Once I had it up and running, I used it in an actual game.
      It went okay, but the biggest critique I had was that it took up a ton of time and attention for me to actually fill out every single action taken by a particular character.
      All of the cool ideas I had for statistic tracking were actually hindering my ability to keep track, and it really took me out of the immersion of the battle and the cool roleplaying and storytelling.

    <blog-section-title>In Conclusion</blog-section-title>
    <blog-p>
      After my first test-drive of the app was around this time that I started looking into the idea of buying a domain and hosting an actual website so that I could do this stuff online instead of just using this tool in a local development environment.
    </blog-p>
    <blog-p>
      Once I made that decision, this tool took more of a backseat as I decided to make my site mainly a Portfolio website / landing page.
      See my <span routerLink="/blog/portfolio" class="link">portfolio blog post</span> to see how that unfolded.

    <blog-h3>Future Goals</blog-h3>
    <blog-p>
      In the near future, I plan on re-implementing a simpler, more realistic version of this app within my Portfolio project, as I have done with some other tools for
      <span routerLink="/blog/bowling" class="link">bowling</span> and
      <span routerLink="/blog/speedrun" class="link">speedrunning</span>.
