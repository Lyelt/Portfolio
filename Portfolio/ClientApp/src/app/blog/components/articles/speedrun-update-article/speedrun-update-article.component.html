    <app-blog-section-title>The Original</app-blog-section-title>
    <p>
      <a class="link" routerLink="/blog/speedrun">In my previous blog post</a>, I talked about my motivation for making this application and some of the technical challenges.
      What I failed to touch on, however, was the usability of the final product.
      The reason for that, truthfully, is that we really hadn't used it at all.
      I tend to go through phases when it comes to hobbies, and I just happened to be on a bit of a downswing in speedrunning after I finalized the application.
      Once I got back into it and started to use it, though, I realized much it left to be desired.

    <app-blog-section-title>Shortcomings</app-blog-section-title>
    <p>
      I was always taught to develop web applications "mobile-first" since so much web traffic occurs via mobile devices, and it's typically easier to convert a mobile design to a desktop design than vice versa.
      In this case, I think that sentiment was actually hindering me.
      The original design was developed with responsiveness in mind, and it looked fine on a small screen.
      The desktop version just looked like the mobile version, but stretched... In other words, it wasn't pretty.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6">
      Not only was it not pretty, it was sort of clunky and hard to actually <i>use</i> on desktop as well.
      I started to think about the actual use case of the application (I <i>am</i> the user, after all) and realized that I could hardly even compare our times on a desktop view.
      That's supposed to be the core feature of the app!
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6">
      So, I took a step back and pondered how to tackle the issue.
      Ultimately, the stretched rows in the desktop view resulted in the times being too far apart to efficiently compare, and the user experience was simply lacking.
      Instead of devoting a ton of time to redesigning the desktop view and implementing responsive styling to handle it, I decided to overhaul the entire page.

    <p>
      Given that my friend and I were the only users, and we knew we only access the page from a desktop, I took the approach of developing "desktop-first".
      The page was redone to look more like a table rather than a bunch of stacked cards, and the times were much closer together and easier to compare. 
      In addition, new features were added for expanding/collapsing specific categories as well as trackers for how many records each of us held.

    </div>
    <p class="mt-6">
      Matt and I started using the new and improved page and immediately felt the difference.
      As we started to invest a lot more time into practicing the game, we also started using the site a lot more to upload our best times and get even more competitive with one another.
      The site seemed to be working as intended at this point: it was facilitating tracking our best times while encouraging us to practice more to stay competitive.

    <app-blog-section-title>In Conclusion</app-blog-section-title>
    <p>
      There are still features I would like to implement, including making a more mobile-friendly version of the page (I know, I kind of went backwards from where I started in this regard).
      Ultimately, though, I am very happy with its current state.
