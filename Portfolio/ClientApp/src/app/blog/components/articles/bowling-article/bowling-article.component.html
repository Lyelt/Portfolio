    <app-blog-section-title>The Idea</app-blog-section-title>
    <p>
      In April 2019, a few friends and I decided to go bowling for fun.
      It was a pretty common thing for us to do, maybe once or twice a year.
      This time, though, we decided we’d get ever-so-slightly more serious about it and start bowling regularly.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6">
      Naturally, I started taking pictures of every game we bowled so I could see how we all improved as we started getting better.
      It wasn’t long before I realized this was a perfect opportunity to build something that would actually be useful - and not only to me, but to all of my friends who bowled as well.

      <p class="italic text-sm p-2">I would take a picture of the score after every game. This is the first one I documented!</p>

    <app-blog-section-title>Getting to Work</app-blog-section-title>
    <p>
      Once I got identity and authentication set up for <span class="link" routerLink="/blog/speedrun">my speedrunning project</span> I couldn’t wait to start working on the bowling app.
      By this point, I had racked up nearly three months worth of bowling scores (the more dedicated of us were bowling 3-4 times a week, so it was adding up) and I wanted the ability to at least <em>start</em> adding the scores to a database.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6">
      I looked to online bowling score calculators for inspiration as to how to actually enter the scores digitally, and started there.
      I figured my friends wouldn’t be entering their scores themselves anyway, so the first step was a barely-working, clunky prototype that got the job done.
    </p>
    <div class="blog-card mt-6">
      <img src="assets/bowling/4.png" alt="Bowling scores" />
      <p class="italic text-sm p-2">There's room for improvement, but it works. This is how games are displayed within a "session".</p>
    </div>
    <p class="mt-6">
      From there, I focused on the backend.
      Since I could actually start analyzing real bowling scores, I was able to do all sorts of calculations to come up with neat stats -
      from basic ones like "Overall Average" and "Strike Percentage" to some more abstract ones like "Single-Pin Spare Percentage".
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6">
      With the backend being serviceable, I looked to a front-end charting library that would play well with Angular, eventually settling on <a href="https://github.com/swimlane/ngx-charts" class="link">ngx-charts</a>.
      I mocked up a design on how the page itself would look and function now that I knew approximately what I was working with.
      I came up with various different ways to chart the bowling scores, and wrote down every statistic I had access to that I thought might be interesting to a bowler.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6">
      As soon as I could, I bulldozed my way to a “minimum viable product” that I could show to my friends.
      It wasn’t pretty, but it was functional, and that’s what I cared about.
      It got some “wow”s from my friends and it allowed me to enter scores with relative ease, which was a success in my eyes.
    </p>
    <div class="blog-card mt-6">
      <img src="assets/bowling/2.png" alt="Bowling chart" />
      <p class="italic text-sm p-2">The current state of the bowling chart, displaying session averages over time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-card mt-6">
      <img src="assets/bowling/3.png" alt="Bowling stats" />
      <p class="italic text-sm p-2">Statistics are shown in a table-like format, separated logically into tabs. These are the "Quick Stats" for Nick (me) from August-September 2019.</p>

    <app-blog-section-title>In Conclusion... Sort Of</app-blog-section-title>
    <p>
      As of the writing of this article, I’m still actively working on this project as I continue to use the tool every week.
      The page got a major facelift when I learned a bit more about UI design and started converting the site to TailwindCSS, but there is still plenty to work on.
